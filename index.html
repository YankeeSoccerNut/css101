    1. A BLOCK level element, by default, takes up ALL the space to the right and to the left, internal to it's parent.
    2.  It CAN have height and width.
    3.  NOTHING can ever be on either side (internal to the parent) because it's 100%.  If you change the width, it will just add margin..  Blocks will ignore margin you add because they are 100%.
    4.  You could add margin on the left, but it will a 'piece' of the auto-margin.
    5.  Container size can be greater than 100% which make inline text bleed output

    Inline Block can have stuff on either side.
    2.  Can have height/width (block positive)
    <div id="container">
      <div id="the-block">
        Some text in a block
      </div>
      <div id="the-block2">
        Some more text in another block
      </div>

      Inline Elements:
      1.  Respect left and right padding, left and right margin BUT will ignore top and bottom
      2.  Doesn't care about what is left or right.
      3.  With few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline element how big to be.
      4.  Will happily ignore all block level rules unless forced to do so.
